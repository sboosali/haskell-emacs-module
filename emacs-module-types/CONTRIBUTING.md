Because this project references and bundles an @Emacs@ source file (i.e. [](./include/emacs-module.h), a header), we should be strict about following the guidelines from the organization of its license ([GNU.org](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/)). 

Thus, **every source file should include this comment** (near the top of the file):


```haskell
